## Technology has made newspapers profitable twice
## Today technology is taking their money away 
#  

When Alfred Harmsworth started the Daily Mail in 1896 he created a new market. The toffs might buy The Times, but here was a paper for the 'man on the Clapham omnibus'.  
The Linotype typesetter made it possible to set type quickly. The rotary press made it possible to print papers quickly. The trains made it possible to get papers to the regions quickly.  
And with sensational reporting of crime, scandal and sport, plus advertising the paper sold in thousands and made Harmsworth millions.  
Workers were cheap, but by the 1960s, they had become expensive and difficult to manage and Harmsworth's heirs were making less money.  
The computer revolution of the 1980s got rid of the hot metal factory and allowed journalists to set type and make up pages. Suddenly, newspapers were making millions again.  
But not for long. In 2000 Google started selling adverts based on what you searched for. Advertisers realised that if you pitched your Ford advert to people who were looking for a new car, you had a much better chance of a sale than if you put it in a newspaper, most of whose readers were not thinking about a new car.  
Today, advertising online is growing fast, and print advertising is falling fast.  
Circulations are dropping as regular readers die out and their children get all their information from their phones.  
With both revenue streams failing, papers are finding it harder to pay for their journalists.  
Newspapers also appear online, either behind a pay wall, which limits the readership, or free, which limits the revenue.  
This is the world of today's newspapers. A constant battle against costs and cheaper online rivals. An inevitable decline in ability and power.
