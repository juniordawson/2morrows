Reporters used to get stories and send them into the office. Now they may be expected to take pictures as well, put them in a slot in the newspaper and in another slot on the website. They may be expected to do a blog, record some video, do a podcast.
They have better tools than ever before. They can do much of their work on a mobile phone, more on a laptop. The Internet is a wonderful reference library.  
Writing was hard work in the old days. It is even harder now.
