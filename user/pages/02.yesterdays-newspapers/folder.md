Newspapers were produced in a hot metal factory from the 19th century to the mid 1980s. 
I was lucky enough to work for the Daily Mail from 1968 until 2010 and to be involved in the technical revolution.  
Yesterday's newspapers looks back at how journalists worked in the old days and how the â€˜inkies' produced the paper.
