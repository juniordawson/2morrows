## The unholy trinity
## 
Three groups of journalists were needed to produce a newspaper in the old days: writers, editors and sub-editors.
Writers discovered things and write about them. Photographers come under the same heading.
Editors decided which of the stories and pictures delivered by the writers and photographers would go in the paper and how they would be displayed.
Sub-editors edited the selected stories and pictures into the space allocated for them. Designers come under the same heading, although they think they are a cut above the subs. They all take orders from the editors.
This is how they worked before the computer revolution and how that change set them and their newspapers free.
