title: 'Sub editing'

Sub editors edited the golden words produced by writers and improved by editors and turned them into newspaper pages.  
They made a story fit the space allowed for it in the paper, made it something people wanted to read and wrote a headline to encourage them to read it.  
In the old days, subs did all this on paper.  
Editors would pass the typed stories to the Chief Sub and he would pass them, in turn, to individual subs.  
Subs had no typewriters or wonder desks. They had pens or pencils. They cut and pasted with scissors and glue - horrible pots of gloop which were filled each day and which ended up with a thick rim of congealed gum, like candles.  
Subs would cut off the reporter's first paragraph and glue it on a fresh sheet of paper so that the intro, which was set in a bigger type, could go to a separate typesetter in the Composing Room.  
They scribbled their changes, or rewrote complete stories - all in handwriting.  
They marked setting instructions for the typesetters on every sheet. 7x10 meant 7pt body type on a column 10 picas wide. A nut each side meant 6 points of space on either side. One point is 1/72 of an inch. One pica is 12pts.  
For headlines, a sub had to mark the typeface, the size and whether it was to be set left, set right or centred: 60 Schoolbook Bold x 54.  
Some of the type was still called by its original French names. Minion and brevere were tiny typefaces used for race cards and a 6pt spacer was a nomp - short for nonpareil.  
Subs had to know how many words would make how many inches when set in metal.  
They had to count the letters in headlines against examples of type in various sizes in their typebooks. In those days, type was not elastic. If your killer headline did not fit in 60pt Schoolbook Bold, you had to write a shorter, less brilliant head which did.
When the copy was subbed and marked up, it was given back to the Chief Sub to check and then on to a Revise editor to check again. Good newspapers still have lots of checks.  
When the Revise man was finished, the copy went into an out basket and a copy boy would roll it up and put it into a pneumatic tube which whisked it up to the composing room on the next floor. These tubes were also used in some shops so that all the money could be handled in a secure accounts department, rather than at individual tills. Some newspapers dropped copy down chutes or hauled it up on dumb waiters; some had moving wires to which copy was clipped.  
The editorial floor was very different from the slick offices newspapers have today. People smoked constantly. People also drank. The subs at the Mail had a ceremony called the Back Stairs Run, in which a sub ran from the subs' desk down the back stairs to the White Swan, known in the trade as the Mucky Duck, drank a pint as quickly as possible and ran back up the stars to his desk before the Chief Sub noticed.  
Now, subs do all the typographical work which used to be done by the composing room hordes. They can turn plain Times Roman words into elegant Gill Sans in the twinkling of an eye. They can make a newspaper page look like something out of Vogue. They can crop and scale a picture this way or that.  
They can write a brilliant headline and if it doesn't fit in 60pt, they can drop it to 59pt, or squeeze it so the 60pt letters are slightly narrower than they should be.  
On the Sports Desk, they can get a match report into the back page seconds after the final whistle, complete with the injury-time goal, and add the managers' quotes minutes later.  They can do more editions, more versions, more changes required by idiot editors than I ever did when I was a sub in the 1960s and 70s.  
And they drink less. Most of them are so busy, they don't have time to eat, never mind drink.  
Sadly, the business of sub-editing is dying out. Technology, which has replaced most of the manual workers in factories, is now replacing knowlege workers in the law and in journalism. Today, skill on a page is more highly valued than skill with words.  
But subs have always done more than master the nuts and bolts of newspaper production. Like those who write advertising copy, they know the mood of the day, the things people are talking about. An algorithm may be able to sum up a story in a headline, but can it can weave the current buzz into a headline which makes you smile?
