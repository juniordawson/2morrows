title: Editing

Before computers, editors, like lawyers and other senior people in companies, saw only the information people gave them on paper.  
On newspapers, the senior people saw all the stories and pictures which were delivered to them. They did not see any stories and pictures which the News Editor had ignored, or was holding for next Sunday.  
Pages were created as sketches on a layout pad and did not appear as type and pictures until they were finished and proofed several hours later.  
Getting anything changed took so long, editors often had to wait until the next edition.  
Now editors can see all the stories and pictures which have been delivered to the office and all those which are running on the internet. They can now say: Why aren't we following up that story about a girl and a snake which is running on YouTube?  
They can also see pages as they are put together and change things immediately from their own computer, without asking a journalist to ask a printer to make the change.  
An editor can do everything himself if he wants - find a story, find some pictures, create a page, put in the story and pictures, write a brilliant headline, then hand it all over to a sub and say: Finish that off.  
Editing is about ideas and technology allows an editor to turn a bright idea into a two-page special in minutes.  
Bright ideas are the difference between a newspaper and the other news available on the internet.
