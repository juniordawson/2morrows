title: Proofing

Proofs were produced at two stages. Type was proofed when it arrived at the random and pages were proofed on the stone when they were finished. 
First, the type had to be inked with a roller which had been rolled up and down on a sheet with tar-like ink daubed on it. Then a damp sheet of copy paper was laid on the type and finally, a dry roller was rolled over the top to press the paper on to the inky type. Proofing paper was kept damp because damp paper produced sharper proofs than dry paper.  
For pages on the stone, this was a manual process, but the random guys had semi-automatic proofers which linked the inky and dry rollers. 
Proofs were needed for the stone subs and the readers, who both marked changes on them, and for the printers - the composing room managers - who checked that pages had been made up correctly.  
Proofs demonstrate the difference between then and now. Journalists could not see a story as it would appear in the newspaper until it had been subbed, revised, typeset in takes and then collated. Now, you can see your story as it will appear in the paper as you write it, either on screen, or printed out.
