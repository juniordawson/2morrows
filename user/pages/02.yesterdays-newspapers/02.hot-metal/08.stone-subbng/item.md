title: 'Stone subbing'
---

Sub editing is about words. Stone subbing was also about man management. The stone sub was an emissary from the enemy in an alien land and he, or occasionally she, had to work out how to get the natives to do what the Editor wanted, even though it went against their training or their union rules.  
If a stone sub had a good relationship with a stonehand, he could get half a line chopped out and the tail of a comma chipped off to make a full stop, which was quicker than getting the line reset. If the stone sub was abrasive, the stonehand could tell him to get stuffed and send the proof back to the Lino to have the line reset. The stone sub had to know when to obey the rules and when to risk bending them.  
And he had to be decisive. If a story had to be changed, or a page had to be killed, he had to say so, no matter how unpopular that was.  
Above all, he had to spot a problem before it was too late. He had to read stories in metal in reverse in the page. And if a caption said Bobby Smith was scoring for Spurs, the stone sub had to check that the metal picture did show that, and was not the earlier picture of Lochhead scoring for Burnley. If the sub waited until the page proof before finding mistakes, there would be no time to correct them.
