title: Reading

Readers worked in pairs, one reader and one copyholder. The copyholder, as his title suggested, had the sub-editors' original copy and read it out. The reader had the proof of the type and checked that what his copyholder said matched the type which had been set.  
If there were mistakes in the typesetting, or if the reader knew that God-fearing should have an initial capital and a hyphen and the sub-editor's copy had neither, he would mark corrections on the proof. As with everything in the printing domain, there were strict rules about how corrections should be marked, all documented in a manual.  
When a copyholder and reader had completed their story, the proof, with its corrections written in, would be sent to the Lino desk, or the case desk and given out to set, just as the original copy was. Individual lines would be set for corrections, not whole sections of a story. When these had been done, the new lines of type would be taken to the random and then to the page, where a stone hand would replace a line with a mistake with the corrected line in the story in his page.
The composing room was a banging, clattering place. The reading room was a quiet, murmering place. And the readers were more cerebral than their printing brothers. They were about words and the accuracy thereof. They also checked the typography, but the words interested them more.
