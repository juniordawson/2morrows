title: 'Picture engraving'

Engraving goes back to the days when the Chinese did printing by hand-carving wooden blocks. 
The process department turned photographs and drawings into screened etchings in metal. A photo is a smooth image. Black blends into grey. To print on newspaper, a picture needs to be screened into rows of raised dots - thick dots for black areas, smaller dots for grey areas.  
The traditional way of doing this was to expose a negative of the image over a light-sensitive layer on a metal plate. Where the light got through the negative, the plate was hardened, where it didn't, the layer was left soft. Acid was then used to etch away the soft areas, leaving the hardened areas as a raised image.
The Germans invented a machine to do this. The Klischograph scanned a photo and engraved the image in dots on metal automatically. It was used by newspapers in the regional press, but Fleet Street continued to use acid engraving until the advent of photocomposition. This may have been because Klischograph pictures were not as sharp as acid-engraved images, or it may have been another example of an old skill being preserved in the face of new techology which de-skilled the job.  
Adverts were produced in the same way.
Artists manipulated pictures in the process department. They used paint brushes or spray guns to lighten or darken areas of a photo, or they could cut the head from one photo and graft it on to another in which the model had looked away. Strangely, when Photoshop replaced paint and scissors, manipulating pictures was still seen as something which should be done in the production area, not in the editorial area, even when bright young artists started showing what they could do with Adobe software in the layout and graphics areas.
