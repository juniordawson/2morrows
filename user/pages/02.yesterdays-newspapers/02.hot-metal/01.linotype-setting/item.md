title: 'Linotype setting'
---

The Linotype was an automatic typesetting machine. It was automatic in that it simplified the business Caxton invented of picking up an individual mould for each letter and arranging them into a line. A skilled operator was still needed to produce newspaper stories quickly.  
The machine had a magazine of matrices - individual moulds for each letter, number and punctuation mark - and a pot of molten metal, heated by electricity and fed by pig of metal dangling into it from a chain and hook.  
The operator used a keyboard - not the standard keyboard we now use on computers, but one with every letter, figure punctuation mark and space the operator needed for the typeface which was loaded on his machine.  
The stories sent up by the sub-editors would be split up by an overseer into takes and given to half a dozen operators. That way, a story could be set more quickly than if it was all given to one man.  
To set a line of type, the operator started typing, copying from the grubby handwritten copy sent up by the subs. As he typed each character, the machine picked up the required matrix and dropped it into position.  
The operator had to judge how many words would fit into one line and space them out by typing in extra space between words, or between letters until the line was justified - filling the required column width from left to right.  
If too much extra space was needed, the operator could hyphenate the next word to justify the line, but this had to be done with care. It was not done to have several consecutive lines ending with hyphens and some words cannot be decently hyphenated. You can split Totten-  
ham, but not Arsenal.  
When each line had been justified, the operator would pull a lever and molten metal from the pot would be squirted into the line of matrices to produce a line of type. Once the line had been set, the machine returned the matrices to their correct positions in the magazine, ready for the next line.  
One at a time, lines of type would be set this way and built up by the operator until he completed his take.  
He would then stick the lines of type into a galley, with the paper copy, and take it to the random, the area in which the various takes of a story were collated into one complete story.  
Operators had to be able to set plain paragraphs, or complex horse racing lists, football league tables or share prices, all in very small type. It was skilled work, it was hot and it was relentless - pick up a take, set it, pick up another, set it, and so on.  
For many of us, the clattering noise made by dozens of Linotype machines defined newspaper production. I well remember visiting Budapest, after we in Britain had all changed to computer setting, and hearing that clattering as I went to a newspaper office in an old, galleried building. When I went into the composing room, there were the Linos, and there were large Hungarian women in aprons operating them.  
The only women in Fleet Street composing rooms were the few brave female sub-editors who supervised the make-up of pages as stone subs. The print unions had strict demarcations between each other and even stricter demarcations against women.
