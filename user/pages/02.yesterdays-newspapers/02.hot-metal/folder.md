For 100 years from the 1880s, once journalists had written, selected and edited their work, they had to pass it over to an army of printers who turned their stories and pictures into pages of type and etched plates.  
The printing staff were divided into separate trades, just as shipyard teams were split into welders, rivetters and plumbers. Some trades set type, some read and corrected, some made up pages, some fetched and carried. 
Each trade belonged to a different union chapel. Each trade took pride in doing its job as its members had been taught during their long apprenticeship. Each trade jealously guarded its bit of work and opposed any attempt to change the way it was done, or merge it with any other trade's bit of work.  
It all took ages and cost thousands of pounds.  
This is how they did it. The technical terms are explained in the jargon page.
