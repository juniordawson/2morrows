title: 'Page make-up'

The stone was where pages were made up. It was called the stone because in the early days, stone was used to provide a flat surface strong enough to hold a page-sized bunch of heavy metal type. In Fleet Street, the stone was a heavy metal bench, waist high and capable of holding four broadsheet newspaper pages, or four pairs of tabloid pages.  
A page was made up in a chase, an oblong metal frame, with two adjustable sides which could be moved inward to lock the type. 
The stonehand made up a page, following the paper layout sent up from the editorial art desk. As stories,  headlines, pictures and adverts arrived from the random, he put them into his chase. He stood on one side of the stone and saw the page upside down and back to front. The other side of the stone was for the stone sub, a journalist who supervised the making up of pages. He saw the page back to front, but the correct way up. The stone sub was not allowed on the other side of the stone and he was forbidden to touch any type.  
When corrected lines arrived, the stonehand would find the original line in a story, lift it out and replace it with the new corrected line.  
When the page was made up, each column was tested for tightness. If any lines were loose, they might drop out when the page was moved to the flong press. Thin strips of metal were used to space out columns. Finally, the type was banged down with a block and mallet to ensure that nothing was sticking up, and the chase was locked, either by pushing down levers, or by tightening screws.
