title: 'Flongs and printing plates'
---

When a page was completed in hot metal, two stages were left before it could be printed. First, a flong was made by pressing a sheet of flexible resin on top of the page under a large hydraulic press. Then the flong was sent down to the foundry where it was curved to act as the mould for a semi-cylindrical printing plate which went on the printing press.  
Taking the page of type from the stone to the press was done very carefully. First, it had to be slid from the stone on to a heavy trolley with an adjustable top which could be raised to the same level as the stone.  The trolley was then wheeled next to the press and the page was slid on to the bed of the press. All the type had to be held tightly in the chase for this to work. I have seen several lines of small type slip from the weather panel in page 2 as the page moved on to the trolley, causing agonising delay while the lines were picked up and shoved back in roughly the right order.
