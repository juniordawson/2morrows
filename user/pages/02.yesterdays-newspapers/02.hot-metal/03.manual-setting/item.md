title: 'Manual setting'

Linotype operators set the body copy - the paragraphs which make up a story. On most papers, headlines were set by a different bunch of people who worked manually, as Caxton did. On the Daily Mail, they were called casehands.  
To set a headline in 36 point Schoolbook Bold, a casehand would stroll over to the type case which held that typeface and pull out the drawer which contained that size. He would pick out the matrices for each letter and assemble them in a stick - a short metal frame.  
When he had a complete line, he would take the stick to a caster which, like the Linotype machine, was designed to squirt molten metal into the matrices. He would then return the matrices to their correct positions in the type tray.  
He would repeat the process for the other lines in a headline - or as much as he could set in one go.  
If a line had more f letters than were available in the case drawer, he would have to set part of the line, then return the matrices so that he had more f letters for the rest of it.  
Once all the lines of a headline were set, the casehand would space them out vertically, put them in a galley and take them with the paper on which the sub-editor had scribbled his headline to the random. 
On the Daily Mail, the casehands also made up complicated sections of pages such as the weather panel with forecasts and temperature tables, or the tax tables which go in on Budget day.
