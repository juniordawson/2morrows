## Tomorrow's news will not come on paper

A newspaper is a package of information designed to attract the biggest share of a mass market. Delivered once a day to a shop near you.  
Tomorrow's news will be My News, tailored to my individual interests. Delivered to me when I want it, how I want it.  
And it will come from many sources not just one brand.  
Will newspapers still be the powerful voice they think they are when they are delivering to me, not the mass market?  
Or will they find it too hard or too expensive to change and will the powerful voice come from an individual to an individual, now that publishing is something anyone can do?  
Donald Trump is using Twitter to publish his thoughts to his people. That reaches more people more effectively and more cheaply than the New York Times does.
