We have sold our car. We simply were not using it enough.
I have been a petrol-head since I bought my first motorcycle at the age of 17. I have taken bikes and cars apart and put them together again. I like knowing how these things work. We have had some wonderful cars. I have had some wonderful motorcycles.
But the world is changing. Young men do not do up cars these days. Cities are providing more and more ways of getting about. And they are restricting cars. It is unpleasant driving in London, or driving out of London to get somehere. I had a car which would do 120mph. In most of London, the speed limit is 20mph. Cycling and Uber are the ways people do it now.
And I am changing as I get older. I am less keen to spend a day in a garage working on a car. I am more inclined to spend time working on a program on a laptop in the flat. 
We can catch a lot of taxis and trains for much less than it was costing us to tax, insure, service and park a car.
But it is not simply a matter of money. Governments, companies and people all have to change as the world changes. If they don't they are left behind. 
We are changing to work with our bit of the world as it is.
