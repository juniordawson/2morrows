title: 'Vote Green and defeat the great pretenders'

I will be voting Green in the general election. Why?
It is the only party which is not pretending that everyone can have a job and is, instead, promising to try out a basic state wage for all.
It is the only party which is not pretending that we will be conquered if we give up our nuclear weapons and is, instead, promising to scrap those nuclear weapons.

Getting rid of immigrants or leaving the EU will not help the employment prospects in the North East. The days when poorly-educated people could earn good money in mines,  shipyards and factories are over.
The days when well-educated people can earn good money doing middling jobs will not last much longer, as Artificial Intelligence proves cheaper and better.
So at some point, politicians will have to work out how to enable people to have meaningful lives without working to put food on the table.
The Greens are tackling that now.

And there is no serious debate about nuclear weapons. Any attempt to start one is quashed by the main parties saying any grown-up knows we would be invaded in five minutes if we didn't have Trident.
As only nine countries have nuclear weapons, the list of naked countries which have not, so far been invaded, is long.
If Germany, Japan and all the other lily-livered countries can get along fine without the wherewithal to blow us all to kingdon come, why can't our insignificant island do likewise?
The Greens are tackling this now.
